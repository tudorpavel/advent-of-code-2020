# Advent of Code 2020

After [reaching only Day 9 using Rust during AoC 2018](https://gitlab.com/tudorpavel/advent-2018), I decided to give Rust another try for [AoC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) and see how far it takes me this time around.

## Setup

To run a particular day, `cd` into the folder and run:

```
cargo run < input.txt
```

To run all tests for a particular day, run:

```
cargo test
```
